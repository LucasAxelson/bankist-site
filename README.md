# bankist-site
 Project from The Modern Javascript Bootcamp 2021 by Jonas Schmedtmann <br>

Welcome to Bankist! Where simplicity meets banking.

This simple yet marvelous project, with a personal touch, is the result of a lots of hours, spread out over a couple of days. <br> 
Modern Javascript taught in a creative way that really helps show some of the many things that can be done within Javascript. <br>
Putting theory into practice. <br> <br>

It's easy watching a hundred hours of lessons, it's something else to actually create something.

A single-page site created with the purpose of training and showing advanced DOM events within vanilla JS. <br>
Screen transitions, sliders, lazy-loading and some other features can be found in the code/site.
